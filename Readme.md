Repo for Breast Cancer Classification task for MSc.

# Introduction
The Original Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database consists of multivariate health and cancer- related data, comprising 699 instances and nine integer-type features. The dataset, structured by chronological groups, spans clinical cases reported periodically by Dr. Wolberg between January 1989 and November 1991 (Wolberg W, 1992)

This analysis aims to utilise machine learning classification techniques on the Original Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database to predict and comprehend breast cancer diagnoses using this dataset. Employing two classification algorithms, Random Forest and Decision Trees, the primary objective is to accurately classify cases as benign or malignant. This involves developing predictive models capable of accurately determining breast cancer diagnoses and evaluating the performances of these classification algorithms.
